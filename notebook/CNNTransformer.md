In this article, we embark on a journey to unravel the intricacies of the CNNTransformer model. By dissecting the code and elucidating each block's functionality, we aim to empower readers with a comprehensive understanding of how this fusion model operates. From input preprocessing to output predictions, we will navigate through the various components, demystifying the magic behind CNNTransformer's ability to tackle complex data and deliver impressive results.

Whether you're a seasoned practitioner delving into the nuances of model architectures or a curious enthusiast eager to comprehend the inner workings of cutting-edge AI, join us as we explore the CNNTransformer in PyTorch, step by step, to unravel the secrets of this potent AI learning paradigm.

## CNN block ##
The CNN_Block is a component that integrates Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) layers, normalization techniques, and residual connections. Its primary components include:
### `nn.Conv1d`:

The `nn.Conv1d` module in PyTorch(https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Conv1d.html) is a versatile 1-dimensional convolutional layer extensively employed for processing sequential data, such as time-series or text data.

The input shape is denoted as `(B, C, T_in)`, where:
    - `B` is the batch size,
    - `C` is the number of input features,
    - `T_in` is the length of the input sequence.

The output shape is denoted as `(B, C_out, T_out)`, where:
    - `N` is the batch size (remains the same as input),
    - `C_out` is the number of output channels, determined by the `out_channels` parameter in the `nn.Conv1d` layer,
    - `T_out` is the length of the output sequence.
    Where T_out is compute as:
        \[ T_{\text{out}} = \left\lfloor \frac{T_{\text{in}} + 2 \times \text{padding} - \text{dilation} \times (\text{kernel\_size} - 1) - 1}{\text{stride}} + 1 \right\rfloor \]

For the given `nn.Conv1d` layer:

```python
self.conv1 = nn.Conv1d(
    in_channels=in_filters,
    out_channels=out_filters,
    kernel_size=filter_size,
    stride=1,
    padding=0,
    dilation=1,
    groups=1,
    bias=True,
    padding_mode='zeros'
)
```
if filter_size is set as 2,the output sequence length is same as the input.
