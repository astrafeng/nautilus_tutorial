From input preprocessing to output predictions, we will navigate through the various components, demystifying the magic behind CNNTransformer's ability to tackle complex data and deliver impressive results.

Whether you're a seasoned practitioner delving into the nuances of model architectures or a curious enthusiast eager to comprehend the inner workings of cutting-edge AI, join us as we explore the CNNTransformer in PyTorch, step by step, to unravel the secrets of this potent AI learning paradigm.

## CNN block ##
The CNN_Block is a component that integrates Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) layers, normalization techniques, and residual connections. Its primary components include:
### `nn.Conv1d`:

The [`nn.Conv1d`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Conv1d.html) module in PyTorch is a versatile 1-dimensional convolutional layer extensively employed for processing sequential data, such as time-series or text data.

The input shape is denoted as `(B, C, T_in)`, where:
`B` is the batch size,
`C` is the number of input features,
`T_in` is the length of the input sequence.

The output shape is denoted as `(B, C_out, T_out)`, where:
`N` is the batch size (remains the same as input),
`C_out` is the number of output channels, determined by the `out_channels` parameter in the `nn.Conv1d` layer,
`T_out` is the length of the output sequence.

Where T_out is compute as:
$$
L_{\text {out }}=\left\lfloor\frac{L_{\text {in }}+2 \times \text { padding }- \text { dilation } \times(\text { kernel_size }-1)-1}{\text { stride }}+1\right\rfloor
$$

For the given `nn.Conv1d` layer:

```python
self.conv1 = nn.Conv1d(
    in_channels=in_filters,
    out_channels=out_filters,
    kernel_size=filter_size,
    stride=1,
    padding=0,
    dilation=1,
    groups=1,
    bias=True,
    padding_mode='zeros'
)
```
if filter_size is set as 2,the output sequence length is the input length plus 1.


### `nn.InstanceNorm1d`:

The [`nn.InstanceNorm1d`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.InstanceNorm1d.html)module in PyTorch is a powerful tool for performing instance normalization on 1-dimensional input tensors. Instance normalization is a technique commonly used to normalize the activations of each instance independently within a batch.You can take a look at [here](ttps://www.google.com/search?newwindow=1&sca_esv=589281839&q=instance+normalization&tbm=isch&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiisIPwoYGDAxU-wzgGHe6sAZUQ0pQJegQICxAB&biw=1087&bih=608&dpr=2.5#imgrc=zs74HRalT-JulM)


For the given `nn.InstanceNorm1d` layer:
```python 
self.normalization1 = nn.InstanceNorm1d(in_filters)
```

The main paramters is the input feature's channel_size in_filters,Which is the number of the input features.This input and the output have the same shape.you can assuming it as the learnable Zscore Indicator in the sequence Length dimension for every sample you input the CNN block.


### `ConstantPad1d`:

The [`ConstantPad1d`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.ConstantPad1d.html) in The CNN Block is used to make sure that after the conv block the Sequence Length is same as the Input length.

## CNNTransformer ##

### `TransformerEncoderLayer`:

TransformerEncoderLayer is made up of self-attn and feedforward network. This standard encoder layer is based on the paper “Attention Is All You Need”.This is a complex attention Layer,We will not explain it in detail.

For the given code:
```python
self.encoder = nn.TransformerEncoderLayer(
    d_model=filter_numbers[-1], 
    nhead=attention_heads, 
    dim_feedforward=hidden_units, 
    dropout=dropout,
    batch_first = True
)
```

The `d_model` is the feature dimension,response to the `C` in CNN Block,`nhead` is the number of heads in the multiheadattention models.`dim_feedforward` is the dimension of the feedforward network model.

When using `batch_first = True`,the input tensor shape like `(batch, sequence_length, feature_dim)`,usually the output tensor has same dimension as the input tensor.
